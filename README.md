🎵 Musician & Technologist 🛠️

As a musician and technologist with a deep interest in both analog electronics and artificial intelligence, I currently lead backend and DSP development at Diktatorial Suite, focusing on an AI-powered audio mastering tool. I'm committed to exploring new technologies while furthering my journey as an artist.
