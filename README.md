🎵 Musician & Technologist 🛠️

As a musician and technologist with a deep interest in both analog electronics and artificial intelligence, I currently lead backend development at Diktatorial Suite, focusing on an AI-powered audio mastering tool that promises to transform the music industry. I'm committed to exploring new technologies in the music industry while furthering my journey as an artist. 

If you're interested in discussing music technology, AI in audio mastering, or any collaborative opportunities, please feel free to reach out to me. I'm always open to sharing ideas.🤘
