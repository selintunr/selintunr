🎵 Musician & Technologist 🛠️

As a self-taught coder, musician, and technologist with a deep interest in both analog electronics and artificial intelligence, I previously served as the CTO of Diktatorial Suite, where we built AI-powered tools for musicians. I'm committed to exploring new technologies while furthering my journey as an artist.
